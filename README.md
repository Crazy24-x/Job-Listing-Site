# Job-Listing-Site
We will be building a Job Listing Site. Design a platform where employers can post jobs and users can apply for them.  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of front-end development using React.js, JSX, CSS, Bootstrap, modern JavaScript (ES6+), and other contemporary web technologies.
